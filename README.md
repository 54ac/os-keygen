## The Obsolete Key Generator

### What is this?

This is an old-school key generator for outdated operating systems from the 90s. Generates 10-digit and 11-digit CD keys, 20-digit OEM Product IDs, and Beta Site IDs with passwords. Made in Javascript.

### What are some of the main features?

- Uses [98.css](https://github.com/jdan/98.css/) and the [IBM EGA 8x14](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/font?ibm_ega_8x14) font for a realistic depiction of the UI of the days of old,
- Uses vanilla Javascript and [md4.js](http://lig-membres.imag.fr/donsez/cours/exemplescourstechnoweb/js_securehash/md4src.html) to generate the requested keys (fully client-side).
